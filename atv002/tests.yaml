# this test matches the exact output
- output: "Hello, World!\n"

# similar to the one above, but ignores case
- output: "Hello, World!\n"
  ignore: case

# the same, but using match instead of output
- match: "Hello, World!\n$"
  ignore: case

# match can be any regular expression (python)
# this test specifies that the output must have
# the two substrings in sequence
- match: .*Hello.*World.*
  ignore: case

# this test requires exact wording of Hello and World
- match: (?=.*\bHello\b.*)(?=.*\bWorld\b.*)
  ignore: case

# this one accepts the words in any order
- match: (?=.*Hello.*)(?=.*World.*)
  ignore: case

# finally, this one consideres any word as acceptable
- match: .*\w+.*
